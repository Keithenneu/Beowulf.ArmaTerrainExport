# Beowulf.ArmaTerrainExport
Just a quick and dirty height data grabber. Exports it to 16bit greyscale png. 1 meter per pixel.

"How hard can it be.."

Just dumped the code here. Create an issue if you need some help actually running it (requires a bit of dev setup tho. Probably not suited for everyone. but not actually hard, jsut takes some time)
